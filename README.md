# AND1-Assignment

// 230+ hours of work later, this still could be better, but its something and I have learned a lot about drawing on Android and logic

Description

I make a game, because i like making games. 
App is a Multi-Game app (currently : Chess and Checkers)


On a more serious note - The application will be a game (exactly what type is still undecided), with multiplayer support and other features of this nature.
All assets used will be CC0 licensed. Hopefully.
If this is not ok for the assignment, please let me know.

Motivation - I enjoy making games, and have made some unfinished ones in the past, and so I hope to make one for this course as well. As I am aiming for an internship with a gamedev company, this only motivates me further.


// I am really bad at identifying requirements, they will also be expanded over the following days as i get more of an idea of what game i want to make

MoSCoW Requirements

The Project must include :
 - A functional chess game (main menu, chess view, majority of chess logic)

The Project should include :
- A matchmaking system via Firebase (done via lobbies)
- Functional Checkers

The Project could include :
Chess:
 - Check-Mate etc solvers
 - Pat (probably wont tho)
 - Castleing logic with firebase support (this is a clownfiesta tbh)
 
Checkers:
 - Double take logic 
 - Checkers -> specific graphics

Multiplayer :
- Full fledged lobby and player system
- Google Authentication

General:
- Background Music
- Sounds for moving pieces

The Project wont include :
  - An ELO system 
  - Finished netowrking because firebase is awful for this instead of a dedicated server or P2P matchamking

NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED (aka the wall of shame)

Multiplayer. Because firebase is bad for that
Checkers. Needs a  bit more time and would have been fine. Also need to download CC0 models for this.
User removal from database. Not really hard but there were more pressing issued
Check-Mate. 
Music. Because .wav and .mp3 files are not recognised for no reason
Nice-looking background. I am not an artist, and thus quite poor at visuals, i really like the blue + white, im sorry :#

Hours Spent : Last Week - ~50h. Chess development during Easter ~180h. I hate my life. Why couldnt i do this in UE4 / Unity like a normal human, that i do not know.
