# AND1-Assignment

Description

I make a game, because i like making games. 
App is a Multi-Game app (currently : Chess and Checkers)


On a more serious note - The application will be a game (exactly what type is still undecided), with multiplayer support and other features of this nature.
All assets used will be CC0 licensed. Hopefully.
If this is not ok for the assignment, please let me know.

Motivation - I enjoy making games, and have made some unfinished ones in the past, and so I hope to make one for this course as well. As I am aiming for an internship with a gamedev company, this only motivates me further.


// I am really bad at identifying requirements, they will also be expanded over the following days as i get more of an idea of what game i want to make
